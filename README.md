#### markdown-warm-up - Website review exercise

# Website reviewed:  (http://www.007museum.com/)

## Purpose
The site is used to accompany and advertise a museum in Norway for the James Bond character from Ian Fleming's books and the following movies.

## Design
The website is one long collection of items the author may have found interesting, seemingly without prioritised order or categorisation, and without the use of layout options to guide the visitor through the content.

## Suggested Changes
The content of this page requires a thorough review, categorisation and prioritisation. Based on the categories, an information architecture for the site must be decided and implemented. This may start with a **navigation** bar splitting the content into various pages to provide better overview over the content covered as well as entry points into it.

If there was a page relating to the various **movies** for example, a next step would be to **group content** pertaining to a specific movie by either creating subpages and content, or by grouping the content visually through location or colour or both.
Laws of vicinity and similarity can group content and guide the user to specific topics.

If this page is designed to drive visitor traffic to the museum then the page needs to provide all **visitor information** any business would require for their customers to know to make a visit as easy as possible, from location information that links to google maps or similar applications to opening times, access fees, permanent vs. temporary exhibitions, and potentially even other interesting attractions in the area to round up a visit.

### In Summary:
* Layout
* Colour
* Structure
* Guidance for visitors
